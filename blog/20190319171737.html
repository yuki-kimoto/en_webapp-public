<h2><a href="/blog/20190319171737.html"> "Perl + Mojolicious" Web application development with Sakura VPS Part 1 Beginning </a></h2>
<p>
  There is no article that consistently deals with everything from the start of development to the deployment of Web applications, so I will write it little by little.
</p>
<h3> Beginning Beginning </h3>
<p>
  There are many books on PHP and Ruby on Rails, and they are quite substantial, so it is easy to create web applications, but I think many people realize that. But when it comes to application performance, Perl uses a framework called Mojolicious and it looks pretty good.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are no steps to publish the application on the Web or in books, so when I try to start doing it, I think it's hard to feel like I want to do it. But in fact, the framework called Mojolicious is very convenient, and the language Perl is also good, so I think I'll tell you by writing this article.
</p>
<h3> Recommended is VPS </h3>
<p>
  I wonder how to publish the application now, but I recommend using VPS or the cloud. I think the cloud is a bit expensive to start with as an individual or a small company. So my recommendation is to use the VPS first and then configure the application so that it can be migrated quickly as it grows.
</p>
<p>
  The cloud has automatic expansion as a service, but the cost is still a little high. Therefore, it is recommended to use VPS to create a web application and design the web application to be extremely portable.
</p>
<p>
  Creating an application that can be used like that will be possible in 1 to 2 hours, including environment construction, once you have learned the procedure and become accustomed to it. Once you write the configuration file, you can reuse it.
</p>
<p>
  For those who are starting from now on, I think that the first time to start a Web application feels like a big mountain. Once you cross that mountain, it will be very easy, so I will explain how to do that.
</p>
<h3> A stance of writing leisurely </h3>
<p>
  I like to write only the main points in a simple way, but I will talk about this article leisurely. If the article continues to the end, I will make the shortest procedure to build the environment properly.
